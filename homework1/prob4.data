We will compare the exact inverse of Hilbert matrices of different
sizes with approximate inverses found with basic Gaussian elemination
and partialy scaled Gaussian elemination by subtracting each element
in the approximation from each element in the exact inverse. The closer
the resulting matrix is to the zero matrix, better the approximation was.
Because these matrices are hard to fit on the screen, instead of showing
them we will sum the absolute value of each element in the compare matrix
and divide by the number of elements in the matrix to get an average element
error. We will also show the result of multiplying the approximations with the
Hilbert matrix to see how close to the identy matrix we get. Again 
Because it is hard to read these matrices on the screen we will print
the average element error from the identy matrix rather than the matrix

All the way up to size 7 the average element error is pretty small but as soon
as we reach size 8, both approximations have huge jumps in their error that keep
getting bigger.  By 25 they are HUGE. What is particularly interesting is that
the difference between the identity matrix and the multiple of the approximation
and the Hilbert matrix never gets that big.  Under size 15 it seems pretty close.
Even at size 25, the error is much bigger than what is acceptable but compared to
the erros in the approximations themselves, they are nothing
